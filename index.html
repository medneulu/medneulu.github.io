        <p>Hello Everyone,<br>
        My name is Medine Ulu. I'm student of Mersin University, Department of Information Systems and Technologies. <br>
        I graduated from Health Vocational High School but in mean time i realized i didn't wanna be a nurse or etc., I have always had an interest in technology since my childhood. <br>
        After this conclusion i decided to continue my education in a different department. That's the reason why i choose this department.

        <p>Like everyone, i have some activities which i enjoy while doing them.<br>
             I like playing computer games like Genshin Impact,LOL(tft) and Stardew Valley. I wish to have a Nintendo Switch for playing <br>
            Zelda Breath of the Wild and Animal Crossing again :'). I have a violin, i try to learn playing it on my own sometimes. <br>
            I like drawing 2D characters, minimal figures and also i enjoy watercoloring. But unfortunately i'm still a beginner so my works aren't that beautiful. </p>    
        <p>In my spare times i usually watch animes and tv series. Nowadays i watch Outlander which is about English and Scottish history. <br>
            My favourite anime shows are Naruto, Bleach, Gintama, Attack On Titan. I also like reading books and comics about history, science fiction and supernatural. </p>

        <center><h2>MY PLANS FOR THE FUTURE</h2></center>
        <p>In 10 years, I see myself teaching character design and game developing on an educational platform like Udemy. <br>
            Plus i want to work in a Japanese company called Sony, of course in Japan. </b> My biggest goal is working and creating funny strategy game with my future game dev team and<br>
            making that game a legend just like Mario or Zelda.

        <center><h2>THE PROJECT IN MY MIND</h2></center>
        <p>I plan to develop a strategy and simulation game. The game will take place in Ragako Village, which is in a fantasy universe.<br>
            In this game you'll own a plot and the tiny house in that area. The game will focus on the Scandinavian mythology.<br>
            In this mythology there are two different divine areas which called Nifleheim and Muspell. Our main character's, the player's, name will be Embla.<br>
            The first woman created. Embla is wronged and killed by the gods. Because of her anger and greed for revenge, her soul cannot rest in peace. <br>
            In short, this will be the theme of the game.<br>
        </p>
        <br>  
    </div>
    <div class="main">
        <center><h2>THE GOAL OF THE PROJECT</h2></center>
        <p>My game project's first goal is reaching to the people who wants to learn Scandinavian mythology. The second goal is presenting <br>
            a game that will make people think while having fun. </p>
    
    </div>
    <div class="main">
        <center><h2>TARGET AUDIENCE OF THE PROJECT</h2></center>
        <p>I aim mostly for players to be over 13 years old, regardless of their profession.<br>
            The game isn't suitable for under 13s due to violent content.<br>
         </p>
     </div>
     <div class="main">
        <center><h2>USERS OF THE PROJECT</h2></center>
        <p> Firstly i plan to release the game as beta version, in Asia and Europe. I guess the vast majority of users will be geek fans and history buffs who likes playing game.<br>
